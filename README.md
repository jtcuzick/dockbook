# DockBook

DockBook is a Streamlit-based web application for structure-based virtual screening. It integrates RDKit for cheminformatics, Open Babel for format conversion and 3D preparation, and py3Dmol for interactive molecular visualization and docking.

## Features

🚀 Run Docking Workflows: Prepare ligands and receptors for docking simulations.

🔄 Format Conversion: Seamless ligand file conversion (SMILES, SDF, PDBQT, etc.) via Open Babel.

🔬 3D Visualization: Interactive molecule rendering powered by py3Dmol.

📊 Batch Screening Support: Process multiple ligands in parallel and export results for downstream analysis in DataWarrior.

## How It Works

- Step 1: Upload receptor and ligand files.  
- Step 2: Ligands are converted into 3D with Open Babel.  
- Step 3: Docking workflow is run (AutoDock Vina or future engines).  
- Step 4: Results are visualized interactively with py3Dmol.
